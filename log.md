# Hangman-Web
*Project Notes*

## Project goals
Create Hangman game in vanilla JavaScript including:
- UI with easy-to-use inputs
    - ideas:
    - https://codepen.io/cathydutton/pen/ldazc
    - http://hangmanjs.andrewhathaway.net/
    - https://jsfiddle.net/phollott/x29ym2ag/
    
- graphics
- possibly sounds
- etc

## Process
- Convert completed and working Python code to JavaScript.
- Optimize
- Design front-end
- etc

## Issues
- Best way to load word list?
- Best way to split up duties?
- Use ES6 / Babel?
- Where to host? Codepen is one idea.

## I'm on...
- Testing and working properly. The prompt window gets in the way when checking hints. But, we're going to make a UI that doesn't have that issue.
